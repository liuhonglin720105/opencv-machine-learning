    "# Chapter 1 A Python Q&A Session\n",
    "## Why Do People Use Python\n",
    "- Software quality\n",
    "    - Python code is designed to be *readable*, and hece reusable and maintainable --- much more so than traditional scripting languages.  In addition, Python has deep support for more advanced *saftware reuses* mechanisma, such as OO and function programing\n",
    "- Developer productivity\n",
    "    - Python  boosts developer productivity many times beyond compiled or statically typed languages such as C, C++, and Jave. \n",
    "    - Python code is typically *one-third to one fifthe* the size of equivalent C++ or Jave code.\n",
    "    - Python programs also sun immediately, without the lengthy compile and link stpes required by some other tools, further boostign programmer speed\n",
    "- Program protability\n",
    "    - Most Python programs run unchaned on *all major computer platforms*.\n",
    "- Support libraries\n",
    "    - Python comes iwth a large collection of prebuilt and portable functionality, known as the *standard library*.\n",
    "    - Python can be extended with both homegrown librtaries and a vast collection of third-party application support software.\n",
    "- Component integration\n",
    "    - Python scripts can easily communicate with other parts of an application, using a variety of integration mechanisms. *customization and extension* tool.\n",
    "- Enjoyment\n",
    "    - Because of Python's ease of use and built-in toolset, it can make the act of programming *more pleasure than chore*.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Of these two factors, the first two (quality and productivity) are probably the most compelling benifits."
